## What and why
- HL7(Health Level 7) refers to a set of international standards for transfer of clinical and administrative data between software applications used by various healthcare providers.
- It focuses on application layer, which is 'layer 7' in [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model).
- Healthcare softwares need to talk with each other in the same language. HL7 tries to be that language.

## HL7 V2
### Intro
- Originally created in 1989, quite a few years from now. Now its got versions 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.3.1, 2.4, 2.5, 2.5.1, 2.6, 2.7, 2.7.1, 2.8, 2.8.1 and 2.8.2. V2 standards are backward compatible.
- Read complete specification [here](http://www.hl7.eu/HL7v2x/v282/std282/hl7.html)(based on 2.8.2)

### Message types and trigger events
Message type and trigger event are interchangable in most cases.

A trigger event is a real-world event that initiates communication and the sending of a message. 

`MSH-9`(9th field of the `MSH` segment) contains message type and trigger event. Message type and trigger event together specifies the type of a HL7 v2 message. For example, `ADT-A01` is a typical `MSH-9` segment value, `ADT`(`ADT` means Admit, Discharge, Transfer) is the message type and `A01` is the trigger event(`A01` means admitted, while `A02` means transferred and `A03` means discharged).

See full list of message type/trigger event [here](https://hl7-definition.caristix.com/v2/HL7v2.5.1/TriggerEvents)(based on v2.5.1).

### Message Structure
- **Message**
- => **Segment**: Each line is a segment, a carriage return `\r` separates one from another. 
- ===> **Field/Composite**: A pipe `|` separates one from another. Fields may contain sub-fields separated by caret `^`.

Example:

> A great search table for HL7 v2 components: [Caristix](https://hl7-definition.caristix.com/v2/) (Search box at top right)
For example, search `ADT_A01`(trigger event), `MSH`(segment), `MSH.9`(Field).

### OID
HL7 Version 3 artefacts use OIDs (unique Object IDentifiers, an ISO standard) to identify coding schemes and identifier namespaces.
See OID Registry table [here](https://www.hl7.org/oid/)
