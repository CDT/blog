## What and why
- Nuxt.js is a higher-level framework built on top of Vue.
- Nuxt.js simplifies the development of universal or single page Vue apps.

### Universal app sv SPA
- Universal app, aka SSR, server side rendering.
- SPA: A website or web appliaction that dynamically rewrites a current page with new data from server, instead of loading entire new paegs.
- Popular SPAs: Gmail, Google maps, Airbnb, Netflix, Pinterest, Paypal.
- A universal app is about having an SPA, but instead of having a blank `index.html` page, the application is preloaded on a web server and sending rendered HTML as the response.
- SPA does poorly on initial loading and SEO, as a lot of content has to be loaded at intial visit and `index.html` is blank which is hard to extract key information. Universal takes priority over SPA on initial loading speed and SEO.
