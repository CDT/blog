## Why Docker

- Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.

## Concepts

- Container

  - is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the DockerAPI or CLI.
  - can be run on local machines, virtual machines or deployed to the cloud.
  - is portable (can be run on any OS).
  - is isolated from other containers and runs its own software, binaries, and configurations.

- Image

 - The image contains the container’s filesystem, it must contain everything needed to run an application
