## What and why
- PWA: Web apps that use progressive enhancement to provide more reliable, more integrated, installable apps.
- It works like native app and can work offline.

## Native vs Hybrid vs PWA
- Native: Apps built using programming language provided by the platform.
- Hybrid: Built with web technology(HTML, JS, CSS) but allow access to platform features that a browser can't provide.
- PWA: Essentially website with instant loading regardless of whether online or offline. Only accessible to platform features that a browser can provide.
