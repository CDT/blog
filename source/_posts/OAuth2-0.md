## What is OAuth 2.0 ?
The industry-standard protocol for authorization. 
This specification and its extensions are being developed within the [IETF OAuth Working Group](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/oauth).

## Authentication vs Authorization
Authentication verifies the identity of a user or service, and authorization determines their access rights.

## Access token
An Access Token is a piece of data that represents the authorization to access resources on behalf of the end-user. 

OAuth 2.0 doesnâ€™t define a specific format for Access Tokens. However, in some contexts, the JSON Web Token (JWT) format is often used. 

### JWT
An open, industry standard [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) method for representing claims securely between two parties.

You can decode, verify and generate JWT.

Includes:
- Header: Algorithm and token type
- Payload: Data
- Signature: verifies data

## Roles
![Four roles](/images/oauth2fourroles.png)
**Resource Owner**: Owner of resource, grants access to them.

**Client**: Requires access to resource, holds token.

**Authorization Server**: Receives requests from the Client for Access Tokens and issues them upon successful authentication and consent by the Resource Owner.

**Resource Server**: Accepts and validates an Access Token from the Client and returns the appropriate resources to it.
